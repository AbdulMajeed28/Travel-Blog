                    <p><span>1. Thailand</span></p>


                    <p>Thailand is where it all began for me so it holds a special place in my heart. It is where I
                        decided to quit my job and travel the world. I lived there. I loved there. Thailand is
                        incredible.

                        It’s also super affordable.

                        With a tourist trail going back decades, Thailand is the heart of backpacking in Southeast Asia,
                        and you can get by on between $25-35 USD per day thanks to cheap guesthouses, budget street food
                        (which can be found for as little as $1 USD!), local buses, and the many cheap and free
                        attractions. If you spend all your time on the islands and inexpensive accommodation, expect to
                        pay closer to $60 USD per day. However, even at the price, Thailand is still one of the most
                        bargain-friendly destinations in the world and should not be skipped!
                    </p>

                    <p><span>2. Central America</span> </p>
                    <p>Want to roam ancient ruins, trek through the jungle, surf, and eat delicious food with few
                        tourists around? Visit the smaller countries in Central America — think El Salvador, Honduras,
                        Nicaragua, and Guatemala. Here you will find most budget hotels for around $15-30 USD per night,
                        meals for under $5 USD, most bus journeys for the same price, and beer for as little as a
                        dollar.

                        Belize, Panama, Costa Rica — these are expensive destinations by regional standards (yet they
                        are still quite affordable). If you visit these central Central American countries, you can get
                        by on $40-50 USD per day as a backpacker or splash out $100 a day and live large. Your money
                        goes really far in this part of the world. And with no many coun tries to choose from, it’s easy
                        to bounce around and see a lot without going broke.</p>
                    <p><span>3. The Balkans </span></p>
                    <img src="all.jpg">
                    <p>Located in southeastern Europe, the Balkans is the cheapest region in Europe. Composed of a
                        handful of countries — most of which see very few tourists — it’s an off-the-radar region that’s
                        super affordable while also offering incredible value. While places like Dubrovnik have seen an
                        influx of tourists (thanks to the cruise ships that dock there), the majority of the region is
                        ripe for adventurous travel. There’s cheap wine, incredible hiking and nature, stunning coasts,
                        hearty food, and wild nightlife. It’s Europe’s best-kept secret.

                        You can get by for as little as $30 USD per day — a fraction of what you’d pay in Western
                        Europe. A week’s worth of groceries costs as little as $25 USD while beer costs around $2 USD.

                        And while the region was once known for being unsafe, things have greatly improved over the past
                        decade. There’s a growing backpacking trail here and tourism is on the rise. It’s Europe’s
                        least-explored region — but not for long so visit before you crowds arrive and the price
                        skyrocket.</p>
